zbase path finding

compiling
1, generate a skeleton from zbase bitmap
2, mark crossing,terminal,turning on the skeleton. call them nodes
   turning is found by connecting two neighbor nodes, 
   and calculate the distance between every point on the path and the line. 
   the farthest point is the turning.

preparing
3, sort x and y separately for the nodes

initializing
4, from start point, use x/y sorting to find k nearest nods.
5, from start point, cast ray to check straight line connectivity to k nearest nodes
   the algorithm guarantees to fine one
6, from end point, find nearest node as above

path finding
7, use weighted aStar to find a path between the start node and the end node

walking
8, when walking towards the next node, do ray casting to the next-next node. if reachable, walk to it instead.

discussion
9, from every crossing node, do line sweeping to find the nearest 3 wall peaks. mark them as peak nodes
